## How to play

Currently included in the MVP are two game modes, a easy one and a harder version of the same game. If there are random colors on the board the screensaver is active. Just push a random button to enter the menu. The menu contains **two** games, green and yellow:

### Green game

Start the game by pushing the **green** button. This is a two player game. Ever player chooses a color: **red** or **orange**.

**Play the game:**

* Every player tries to push his own color (red or orange)
* The first player who reaches a score of 10, wins!
* The winning color is shown at the end
* The single purple dot gets you back into the menu
* **Attention:** pushing a non colored dot resets the positions!

### Yellow game

Start the game by pushing the **yellow** button. This is a two player game. Ever player chooses a color: **red** or **orange**.

* Every player tries to push his own color (red or orange)
* After 500ms the position of the dots resets
* The first player who reaches a score of 10, wins!
* The winning color is shown at the end
* The single purple dot gets you back into the menu
* **Attention:** pushing a non colored dot resets the positions!

## Requirements

### Required Hardware

- Arduino AT Mega
- Adafruit NeoPixels
- Arcade Buttons

### Required software

- Node.js >=8
- NPM >= 5

## Getting started

### Hardware

Connect the Arduino to (placed under the table) to the Raspberry Pi with the provided cable. If both are connected you can connect the Arduino with the power cord; all LEDs are blue now. After the boot is completed the menu appears.

### Development

#### Setup

```
npm install
npm start
```

#### Run tests

```sh
npm test
# or
npm run test:watch
```

Also you can lint the files with:

```sh
npm run lint
```

#### Emulate hardware

To use an emulated hardware use the following command and visit `http://localhost:4000`:

```sh
npm run emulate -- --skipSetup
```

#### Skip setup

Currently included for dev purpose to skip setup for a 4x4 Pixel Board.

```sh
npm start -- --skipSetup
```

#### Solve setup

The setup is to detect the actual board size used on a table. The following steps are necessary to setup the board:

* On start: the first button is `red`
* Press the red button: the button is now `green`
* Press the button on the edge to the right of the green button: the button is now `green`
* Now press the button located on the buttom from the last one pressed: the button is now `green`
* The setup is complete and the game menu appears

The following schema describes the setup again, where:

* `o = off`
* `r = red`
* `g = green`
* `y = yellow`

On setup, the first button appears `red`:

```
r  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
```

Press the button, it is now `green`:

```
g  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
```

Next press the most right button, it should also appear `green`:

```
g  o  o  g
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
```

Now press the bottom button located from the last one pressed, it also should light up `green`:

```
g  o  o  g
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  g
```

**The setup is finished the game menu should appear!** The board looks now like this is its final state:

```
g  o  o  o
o  y  o  o
o  o  o  o
o  o  o  o
```

#### Architecture

- Firmata with support for NeoPixel is running on the Arduino MEGA
- NodeJS Johnny Five app connects via serial to the firmata on the arduino
- NodeJS Johnny Five app has full control over the arduino

#### Hardware layout

Schema has been created with [fritzing][1], the source file is available at `schema.fzz` and `schema.svg`

#### Testing Button

- Pin 51, 53 are configured as input with PULL UP resistors to get clear states for pushed button
- The NeoPixel LEDs must be connected to digital PWM PIN 2 - 13 ( currently 13 ) otherwise it is not working
- The arcade buttons can be attachted to digital PIN 2 - 53
